## About Swap

Swap is a free online platform that allows students to connect with fellow classmates and exchange goods.

Swap allows students to post items they donâ€™t need while giving others the opportunity to find exactly what they want. We offer exclusivity, convenience, and specialized features which are not available on conventional forums or typical free and for sale message boards. One such features, allows students to enter their courses to find items that are directly related. This makes finding textbooks, lab equipment, and other course material seamless and tailored to individual students needs.

As hungry students themselves, the founders of Swap wanted to contribute to the community and provide a platform where students can connect and add to their school life. As an exclusive marketplace for Berkeley students, it is safer, more local, and more convenient.

```Ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  def fb_id(access_token)
    graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(access_token)
    profile = graph.get_object("me")
    return profile["id"]
  rescue
    return nil
  end

  def fb_auth_user(access_token)
    user = nil
    begin
      graph = Koala::Facebook::API.new(access_token)
      profile = graph.get_object("me")
      fb_id = profile["id"]
      user = User.find_by(fb_id: fb_id)
    rescue
      return nil
    end

    if user && (user.fb_picture.nil? || user.first_name.nil? || user.last_name.nil?)
      first_name, last_name = profile["name"].split(" ")
      fb_picture = graph.get_picture(fb_id)
      user.update(
        fb_picture: fb_picture,
        first_name: first_name,
        last_name: last_name
      )
    end
    user
  end
end
```

### Web Scraper - Courses

Utilized Nokogiri gem to scrape courses directly from UC Berkeley. Students can add all their courses and easily search for posts only related to those courses.

```Ruby
require 'HTTParty'
require 'Nokogiri'
require 'JSON'
require 'Pry'
require 'CSV'
require_relative "links"

data = []

Links.links.each do |link|
  page = HTTParty.get(link)

  parse_page = Nokogiri::HTML(page)

  parse_page.css('.courseblocktitle').map do |course|
    parsed_course = {
      course_number: course.css('.code').text,
      course_title: course.css('.title').text
    }
    data.push(parsed_course)
  end
end

Pry.start(binding)

CSV.open("data.csv", "wb") do |csv|
  csv << data.first.keys
  data.each do |hash|
    csv << hash.values
  end
end
```

            :category, presence: true

  validates_presence_of :price, :if => Proc.new { |post| post.category != 'Lost & Found' }
  validates_presence_of :address, :lat, :lng, :start_date, :end_date, :if => Proc.new { |post| post.category == 'Housing' }

  has_many :bookmarks
  belongs_to :course, inverse_of: :posts, optional: true
  belongs_to :user

  after_create :check_rfps

  def check_rfps
    Rfp.all.each do |rfp|
      check_relevance(rfp.description, rfp.user)
    end
  end

  def check_relevance(description, user)
    post = self.as_json
    relevance_score = calc_score(post, description)
    if relevance_score >= 10
      UserMailer.rfp_alert(user, post, description).deliver
    end
  end

  private

  def calc_score(post, query)
    query = query.split(' ')
    score = 0
    max = 0

    query.each do |word|
      max += word.length
      if post['title'].downcase.include? word.downcase
        score += word.length
      end
    end

    score
  end
end
```

- Checks the last message of each conversation and updates whether it has been delivered / seen.
- Message templates are dynamically generated for every posts allowing users to easily copy and send.
